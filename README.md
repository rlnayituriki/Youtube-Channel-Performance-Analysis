**ALI ABDAAL YOUTUBE CHANNEL PERFOMANCE ANALYSIS**

In this project, I analysed the perfomance of one of my favorite Youtubers, Ali Abdaal, to gain insights about which videos have the most and least views and what days of the week are best to post content, and produced a wordcloud for video titles. 

Data Source: I scraped the data from Youtube data API 

**KEY TAKEAWAYS**

-Self help videos related to academics have the most views, therefore, Ally should focus on them more. 

-Videos about history of places are the least performing in terms of views, Ali should probably spend less time on those and focus on what works.

-Tuesday and Wednesdays are the best days to Publish content, since those two days have relatively the highest number of views.
